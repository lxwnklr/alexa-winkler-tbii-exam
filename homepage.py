You can learn a lot about cross-country skiing with the provided links in the 'Learn more'-section and test your knowledge with the quiz. Do you want to start with skiing? Great! Then you can track your progress! Or do you want to wax your own ski for an even better pace? Just click on 'What to wax' to see what the temperature will be and what you should wax according to it. And if you have a bad day and want to skip training just press the 'Click here to get some motivation!'-button and see what happens!")
